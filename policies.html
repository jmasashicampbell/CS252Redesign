                        <li>
                            Understand abstract models for computing machines
                            including finite automata, push-down automata, and Turing machines.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Understand common notations for defining languages
                            such as regular expressions and grammars.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Understand what kinds of problems are computable
                            and what kinds are not computable.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Understand what kinds of problems are easy to compute
                            and what kinds are hard to compute.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Think and reason carefully about computation.
                            Write about computation clearly and precisely.
                            Use rigorous methods, representations,
                            and proof techniques.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Apply theoretical concepts to practical problems
                            such as using grammars for parsing programming languages
                            and using finite automata and regular expressions
                            for string searching and pattern matching.
                        </li>

                        by Michael Sipser. (ISBN: 978-1-133-18779-0)
                        We will cover much of the text following the provided schedule.
                        Please read the material for a given day prior to that day's lecture.

                        Exams
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        Exams consist of a Midterm and a comprehensive Final.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The midterm exam will be available
                        for one or more normal testing days
                        as well as one or more make-up days.
                        You should plan to take the exam on one of the normal testing days.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The make-up days are reserved for situations such as
                        unexpected circumstances,
                        UAC accommodations,
                        those who forget to take the test,
                        or misunderstand the testing schedule.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Points will be deducted from your test score
                        if you take the exam on a make-up day.
                        The point deduction for taking the exam
                        on a make-up day is calculated based on
                        five points per day.
                        The deduction for the first day is five points,
                        the second day is ten points, and so on.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You must take the exam on either a normal day
                        or a make-up day, no exceptions.
                        After the end of the make-up days,
                        the exam is no longer available.
                        You need to plan take the exam on a normal testing day
                        so that if an unexpected circumstance arises
                        or you forget the test or misunderstand the schedule,
                        you will be able to complete the exam on a make-up day.

                    <p>
                        In keeping with the principles of the BYU Honor Code, students are expected
                        to be honest in all of their academic work. Academic honesty means, most
                        fundamentally, that any work you present as your own must in fact be your
                        own work and not that of another. Violations of this principle may result
                        in a failing grade in the course and additional disciplinary action by the
                        university.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Students are also expected to adhere to the Dress and Grooming Standards.
                        Adherence demonstrates respect for yourself and others and ensures an
                        effective learning and working environment. It is the university's
                        expectation, and my own expectation in class, that each student will abide
                        by all Honor Code standards. Please call the Honor Code Office at 422-2847
                        if you have questions about those standards.

                        Preventing Sexual Misconduct
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        As required by Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the
                        university prohibits sex discrimination against any participant in its
                        education programs or activities. Title IX also prohibits sexual
                        harassment including sexual violence committed by or against
                        students, university employees, and visitors to campus. As outlined in
                        university policy, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic
                        violence, sexual assault, and stalking are considered forms of "Sexual
                        Misconduct" prohibited by the university.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        University policy requires any university employee in a teaching,
                        managerial, or supervisory role to report incidents of Sexual
                        Misconduct that come to their attention through various forms
                        including face-to-face conversation, a written class assignment or
                        paper, class discussion, email, text, or social media post. If you
                        encounter Sexual Misconduct, please contact the Title IX Coordinator
                        at t9coordinator@byu.edu or 801-422-2130 or Ethics Point at
                        https://titleix.byu.edu/report-concern or 1-888-238-1062
                        (24-hours). Additional information about Title IX and resources
